    <h2>Academic Recommender</h2>
    <h3>A website designed by students, for students!</h3>
    <p>
      ACAR provides students with a powerful tool for academic research and schedule organisation. The app offers information about
      faculties at "Universitatea Alexandru Ioan Cuza" from Iasi, Romania.
    </p>
    <p>
      For each faculty, we bring useful resources on each subject, course readings and notes and other information students may
      need or may find useful In order to access this information, a student just needs to
      <a href="./register.php">Create An Account</a> and start browsing our menu to identificate the subject he or she needs help on. You're just
      a few clicks away from the best source of information "UAIC" has ever had!
    </p>
    <p>
      ACAR also listens to its users through the Add Review page, where students can create or answer review related to college
      activities, professors and other studies. By using the Review page, students are surely getting the most recent and
      updated data they can possibly get from any other source! We cover everything. From usual subjects, to professors,
      schedules and even the day to day life of a student at "UAIC".
    </p>
    <p>All this being said, we encourage you to roll in today and start doing your own reviews!</p>
